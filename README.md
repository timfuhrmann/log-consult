In progress: converting one of my older Angular applications ([Log & Consult](https://log-consult.net/)) to a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) and [Contentful's GraphQL API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/graphql/).

### Static Product Page Generation
A similar usage including documentation can be found [within one of my other repos.](https://github.com/timfuhrmann/next-graphql-apollo-contentful)

### Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
